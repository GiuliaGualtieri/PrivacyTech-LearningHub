# PrivacyTech-LearningHub ðŸ“š
**PrivacyTech-LearningHub** is a centralized resource dedicated to the study and exploration of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). 
This repository collects theoretical materials, articles, videos, workshops, and links to academic and industry resources on topics including:
- **Differential Privacy**
- **Federated Learning**
- **Homomorphic Encryption**
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**
and other data privacy innovations.

**Objective**: This repository serves as a structured hub for my studies, helping me track and build upon my knowledge in PETs. 
I hope it also provides value to others seeking insights and information in the evolving field of privacy technology. 
It could provide a comprehensive and accessible knowledge base for anyone interested in exploring the theoretical foundations and latest advancements in privacy technologies. 
Whether you're a researcher, student, or industry professional, here youâ€™ll find curated resources to support your learning and deepen your understanding of PETs.
